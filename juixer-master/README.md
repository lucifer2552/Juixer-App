"Juixer - A Bartender" is a web based application that helps people to be expressive and choose a drink to enlighten their mood. It is self expressive with no third party interference. It saves time and is user friendly. This web based application works on the principle of Sentiment Analysis where users response is used to suggest them a cocktail which best suits their mood. 

The suggestions provided are not only based on sentiment
analysis but also with respect to a particular occasion or a season. Another salient feature of this web based application is that cocktails are suggested with their recipe too, which means that users can try making the cocktails on their own at any place and any time.
